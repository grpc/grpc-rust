//! The xDS data model layer: validated, owned representations of the raw
//! discovery-protocol resources (LDS/RDS/CDS/EDS), each implementing
//! [`xds_client::Resource`] so it can be deserialized, named, and validated
//! (gRFC A27) independently of any live xDS traffic.
//! The dependency manager assembles these into an [`crate::xds_config::XdsConfig`].

// TODO: remove once the xDS dependency manager subscribes to these resource
// types and assembles them into an XdsConfig.
