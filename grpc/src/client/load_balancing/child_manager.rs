//! Utilities which help parent LB policies manage child LB policies.
//!
//! [`Child`] wraps a single child LB policy.  It hides the routing of work
//! items to the child and records the child's most recent [`LbState`] instead
//! of forwarding it to the channel.  Use this directly when the parent has a
//! small, fixed set of children that it wants to drive individually.
//!
//! [`ChildManager`] manages a dynamic set of [`Child`]ren derived from the
//! contents of each resolver update, and forwards channel updates to all of
//! them.  Use this when the children are a pure function of the most recent
//! update (e.g. round robin, which creates one child per endpoint).
