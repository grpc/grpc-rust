//! Priority Load Balancing Policy (`priority_experimental`).
//!
//! This module implements the `priority_experimental` load balancing policy as
//! specified in [gRFC A56: `priority_experimental` LB policy] and updated by
//! [gRFC A115: disable Priority LB policy child policy retention cache].
//!
//! # Overview
//!
//! The priority LB policy manages an ordered list of child policies. It routes
//! RPCs to the highest-priority child that is reachable (in `READY` or `IDLE`
//! state). If higher-priority children are unavailable, fail, or take too long
//! to connect, the policy fails over to lower-priority children.
//!
//! Each endpoint in a [`ResolverUpdate`] delivered to the priority LB must be
//! annotated with a hierarchical path attribute
//! (see [gRFC A56: Hierarchical Addresses]), otherwise, it will be ignored.
//!
