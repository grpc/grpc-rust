//! xDS-backed discovery for the `tonic-xds-lb` load balancer.
//!
//! Unlike the `tower-lb` path (which connects inside discovery and yields
//! ready [`EndpointChannel`]s), the in-crate `LoadBalancer` manages the
//! connection lifecycle itself. So this module provides two decoupled pieces:
//!
//! 1. [`discover_endpoints`] — diffs EDS snapshots into
//!    `Change<EndpointAddress, IdleChannel>` events (addresses only; no
//!    connection is established here).
//! 2. [`XdsLbConnector`] — the [`Connector`] the `LoadBalancer` calls to turn
//!    an address into a live channel. Because [`Connector::connect`] returns a
//!    future, the connector is handed to the LB synchronously and resolves the
//!    cluster's CDS security config *inside* that future via
//!    [`build_connector`]. If CDS has not arrived yet (or a CDS update fails
//!    validation), the connect future parks until a valid config is available.
//! 
//! TODO: handle the case where the cluster is removed from the cache while a connect future is pending.
//! Currently, the future will park forever, it should instead try to re-establish the cluster watch and
//! only fail-fast when the client is closed.
